# Hi there, I'm Supun Gamlath ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and robotics programming. I love to collaborate with others and continuously expand my knowledge. 

When I'm not buried under university studies, you'll catch me hiking with buddies, diving into hackathons, or tinkering away on some cool project!

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
Here is the latest project I'm working on:

* Autonomous Robot Navigation - I'm using a Kobuki robot powered by a Jetson Nano B01 and Xbox360 Kinect Camera to autonomously map and navigate an arena, using ROS2 Foxy and packages such as nav2, rtabmap_ros, and kinect_ros2.

## ðŸš€ Recent Projects
Here are some of the recent projects I completed:

* [Fall Detection App](https://fall-detection.streamlit.app/) - Developed a Streamlit app with openpifpaf and PyTorch utilizing a LSTM model for human fall detection.
* [IFS x Hatch ChallengerX Program](https://ifs-challengerx.hatch.lk/) - AI/ML Incubator program by IFS and Hatch focusing on developing models to predcit damage caused by natural disasters.
* [Asia Pacific RoboCon 2023](https://supungamlath.github.io/rabbit-robot.html) - International Robotics competition held this year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Our team of 3 undergrads was selected to represent Sri Lanka and we developed two robots for the given task. I was responsible for constructing the "Rabbit Robot" and programming both robots.  

## ðŸŒ± Recent Learning
I'm always learning and trying to improve my skills. Here are some of the things I've been learning recently:

* Deep Learning - Following the Coursera specialization by DeepLearning.AI
* Robotics - Completed ROS2 Foxy course on Udemy. 
* Machine Learning - Completed machine learning courses on Kaggle.
